The project is at a very early stage

We must brainstorm to create new user experiences

We must brainstorm to create lively new content

Our audience is young, troubled, impatient

Our audience are like gamers. They want action, control and responsiveness,

We need to create a system that creates new feelings

We need a way for remixing content to make it get better and better

We need both to follow and to lead fashions

We learn from the graffiti artists. We imitate each other. We push each other

Every week we add and build new repositories.

Each repo is a new work of art - a coding graffiti

Every repo belongs to an artist/coder or a collaboration of artists and coders

All work is oen source and may be copied and remixed by other artists

Here is an idea

We all create our own repositories.

We copy each others ideas, text and images and turn them into our own vision

We are graffiti artists pointing the way toward a good, kind life of adventure

We have different styles. We say things in different ways. We have different objectives.

And

We all collaborate. We help and coach each other. We have fun
